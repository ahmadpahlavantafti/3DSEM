# 3D SEM Surface Reconstruction

<p align="justify">
Structural analysis of microscopic objects has been a longstanding topic in several scientific disciplines, such as biological, medical, mechanical, and materials sciences. The scanning electron microscope (<strong>SEM</strong>), as a very promising imaging equipment has been around for decades to analyze the surface properties (e.g., compositions or geometries) of microscopic samples by achieving increased magnification, contrast, and resolution greater than one nanometer [1]. While SEM micrographs still remain two-dimensional (2D), many research and educational questions truly require information about their three-dimensional (3D) structures. 3D surface reconstruction from SEM images leads to remarkable understanding of microscopic surfaces, allowing informative and qualitative visualization of the samples being investigated. The (<strong>objective</strong>) of this GitHub repository is to provide a source for 3D SEM surface reconstruction study, presenting recent advances and progresses to the research community.
