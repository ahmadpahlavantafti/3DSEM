# 3D SEM Surface Reconstruction

<p align="justify">
Structural analysis of microscopic objects has been a longstanding topic in several scientific disciplines, such as biological, medical, mechanical, and materials sciences. The scanning electron microscope (<strong>SEM</strong>), as a very promising imaging equipment has been around for decades to analyze the surface properties (e.g., compositions or geometries) of microscopic samples by achieving increased magnification, contrast, and resolution greater than one nanometer <strong>[1]</strong>. While SEM micrographs still remain two-dimensional (2D), many research and educational questions truly require information about their three-dimensional (3D) structures. 3D surface reconstruction from SEM images leads to remarkable understanding of microscopic surfaces, allowing informative and qualitative visualization of the samples being investigated. The (<strong>objective</strong>) of this GitHub repository is to provide a source for 3D SEM surface reconstruction study, presenting recent 3D SEM advances and progresses to the research community.

Making a 3D shape model of a microscopic sample is still difficult to solve since its 3D shape model in the real world is only projected into and available as only 2D digital images. Over the past few years, there has been an expansion in designing and developing 3D surface reconstruction algorithms for images obtained by a SEM. All these algorithms are categorized into three main classes: 1) Single-View, 2) Multi-View and 3) Hybrid <strong>[1, 2]</strong>, all with use of either sparse or dense reconstruction strategies.
